The Java Class

This is a class

public class MyFirstApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}

1. public class MyFirstApp {
- public → Means anyone can use this class.
- class → A blueprint or container where your code lives.
- MyFirstApp → The name of the class.
- The file name must be the same: MyFirstApp.java.
- { → Opening curly brace → says “everything inside belongs to this class.”
Think of this as opening the door to your program’s house.

2. public static void main(String[] args) {
This is the starting point of every Java program. Let’s break each word:
- public → Anyone can run this method.
- static → Belongs to the class itself, not an object.
- void → Means this method doesn’t return anything.
- main → Special name → Java looks for this method first when running.
- (String[] args) → A list (array) of words you can pass from the command line.
- { → Opening curly brace → says “everything inside belongs to this method.”
Think of this as the main room inside the house where the action starts.

3. System.out.print("I love Java");
- System → A built-in class in Java.
- out → Represents the screen (standard output).
- print → Prints text on the screen (without moving to a new line).
- ("I love Java") → The message you want to show.
- ; → Semicolon → like a full stop at the end of a sentence.
This is the activity happening inside the room.

4. } (closing brace for main method)
- Marks the end of the main method.
 Think of it as closing the door to the room.

5. } (closing brace for class)
- Marks the end of the class.
Think of it as closing the door to the house.

 Beginner-Friendly Analogy
Imagine you’re writing a story inside a house:
- Class { } → The house itself.
- Main method { } → The main room where the story begins.
- Statements (System.out.print) → The actions happening in the room.
- Semicolon ; → A full stop at the end of each instruction.
- Curly braces { } → Walls that show where things start and end.
Flow: House → Room → Action → Close Room → Close House.

Visual Nesting Diagram
Class MyFirstApp {
    └── Main Method {
            └── Statement (System.out.print)
        }  <-- end of method
}  <-- end of class


Importance of Main Method
1. Entry Point for Execution
- Every Java program needs a starting point.
- The JVM looks for public static void main(String[] args) as the default entry method.
- If the main() method is missing, the program compiles but cannot execute.

2. Why the Signature Matters
- public → Accessible by the JVM from outside the class.
- static → Can be called without creating an object of the class.
- void → Doesn’t return anything to the JVM.
- String[] args → Accepts command‑line arguments for runtime input.
If you change this signature, the JVM won’t recognize it as the entry point.

3. Bridge Between Code and JVM
- Every Java program needs a starting point.
- The JVM looks for public static void main(String[] args) as the default entry method.
- If the main() method is missing, the program compiles but cannot execute.
