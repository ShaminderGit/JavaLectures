Section Two
Chapter 3 JDK VS JRE VS JVM

The Three Pillars of Java
1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Role: The engine that runs Java bytecode (.class files).
- How it works:
- Takes compiled bytecode and translates it into machine code for the host OS.
- Handles memory management (heap, stack), garbage collection, and security.
- Platform dependency:
- JVM itself is platform‑dependent (different builds for Windows, Linux, Mac).
- But bytecode is platform‑independent → “Write Once, Run Anywhere.”
- JVM is why Java programs can run on any system, as long as the right JVM is installed.
- Platform independent (effect):
- The bytecode it runs (.class files) is the same everywhere.
- That’s why Java programs don’t need to be rewritten for each OS — the JVM handles the differences.
 “JVM is platform dependent, but it makes Java bytecode platform independent.”


2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- Role: Provides everything needed to run Java programs.
- Contents:
- JVM (the engine).
- Core libraries (e.g., java.lang, java.util, java.io).
- Supporting files (configuration, runtime classes).
- Use case: End‑users who just want to run Java apps install the JRE.
- Key point for students: JRE = JVM + libraries → the “playground” for running Java.
- Platform dependent:
- The JRE package includes the JVM and supporting libraries, and it’s compiled differently for each OS.
- Platform independent (effect):
- The Java libraries inside the JRE (like java.util, java.io) are the same across all platforms.
- So any Java program using these libraries runs consistently everywhere.
JRE is platform dependent because it bundles a JVM for each OS, but it provides a consistent environment across platforms.”


3. JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Full toolkit for developers to write, compile, and debug Java code.
- Contents:
- Compiler (javac) → converts .java source into .class bytecode.
- Debugging tools (jdb), documentation tools (javadoc).
- Includes the JRE (so you can run what you compile).
- Use case: Required if you want to develop Java programs.
- JDK = JRE + development tools → the “workshop” for building Java.
- Platform dependent:
- The JDK tools (compiler javac, debugger, etc.) are built for specific operating systems.
- Platform independent (effect):
- The bytecode produced by the JDK compiler is platform independent.
- Developers can write code once, and the compiled .class files will run anywhere a JVM exists.
“JDK is platform dependent as a toolkit, but the code it produces is platform independent.”


The JVM is not built by one company only. Oracle maintains the official HotSpot JVM,
but many organizations (IBM, Azul, Amazon, Red Hat) also build their own JVMs.
That’s why Java is portable and flexible the bytecode is universal, but each vendor provides a
JVM tailored to their platform.
