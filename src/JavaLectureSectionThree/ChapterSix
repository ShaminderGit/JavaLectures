Type Conversion and Casting in Java

What is Type Conversion?
- Type Conversion means changing a variable from one data type to another.
- In Java, this happens in two ways:
- Implicit Conversion (Type Promotion / Widening)
- Explicit Conversion (Type Casting / Narrowing)
 Analogy:
Think of it as pouring water into containers of different sizes:
- If you pour water from a small glass into a bigger jug → safe, automatic (widening).
- If you pour water from a big jug into a small glass → risky, must be done carefully (narrowing).

 1. Implicit Conversion (Widening)
- Happens automatically when a smaller type is assigned to a larger type.
- No data loss, safe conversion.
- Example: byte → short → int → long → float → double
 2. Explicit Conversion (Narrowing / Casting)
- Done manually using parentheses (type).
- Risky because data may be lost.
- Example: double → float → long → int → short → byte

double pi = 3.14159;
int value = (int) pi;   // explicit casting
System.out.println(value); // Output: 3

Widening (Automatic, Safe)
byte → short → int → long → float → double

Narrowing (Manual, Risky)
double → float → long → int → short → byte

 Special Cases
- char to int → Unicode value is stored.
char ch = 'A';
int code = ch;   // implicit
System.out.println(code); // Output: 65
- int to char → Explicit casting required.
int code = 66;
char ch = (char) code;
System.out.println(ch); // Output: B
- Type Casting in Expressions
int a = 5, b = 2;
double result = (double) a / b; // Output: 2.5
