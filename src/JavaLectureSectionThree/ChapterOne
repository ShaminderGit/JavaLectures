Variables and Memory Basics

Memory in Computing
What is Memory?
- Memory is the workspace of a computer where data and instructions are stored so the CPU can use them.
- It’s temporary (RAM) or permanent (Disk/SSD).
 Analogy
Think of memory as a student’s desk and bookshelf:
- Desk (RAM): Books and notes you’re using right now — fast but cleared when you leave.
- Bookshelf (Hard Drive/SSD): Permanent storage — books remain even after you leave.
- Sticky notes (Cache): Quick reminders right on the desk — very fast, but small.


Variables in Java
What is a Variable?
- A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds data while your program runs.
- It has:
- Name (identifier): The label.
- Type: Defines what kind of data it can store (int, double, String).
- Value: The actual data stored.

int age = 20;        // variable 'age' stores number 20
String name = "NIT"; // variable 'name' stores text

Analogy
Think of a variable as a locker in a hostel:
- Locker name tag: Variable name.
- Locker type: What kind of item it can hold (numbers, text, etc.).
- Locker contents: The actual value stored.


Types of Variables
- Local Variables → Notes on your desk (exist only while you’re studying).
- Instance Variables → Personal locker (unique to each student/object).
- Static Variables → Notice board in hostel (shared by everyone).

 Primitive vs Reference Variables
- Primitive Variables: Store actual values directly (like a book inside the locker).
- Reference Variables: Store an address pointing to another room
 (locker has a note with directions to where the object is stored in heap).
Example:
int a = 10;             // primitive, value stored directly
String str = "Hello";   // reference, points to object in heap

Final Takeaway
- Memory = workspace (desk, bookshelf, sticky notes).
- Variable = named locker in memory.
- Primitive variables = store values directly.
- Reference variables = store addresses pointing to objects.
- Variables can be local, instance, or static depending on where they’re declared.
