Rules for Identifiers in Java
 1. Allowed Characters
- Can contain letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), underscore _, and dollar sign $.
- Analogy: Think of identifiers as name tags on lockers — you can use letters, numbers, or simple symbols like _ and $.

 2. Must Start Correctly
- Must start with a letter, underscore _, or dollar $.
- Cannot start with a digit.
- Analogy: A locker name cannot start with a number (like 123locker), it must start with a proper tag.
 Valid: age, _count, $salary
 Invalid: 1value

 3. Case Sensitivity
- Java identifiers are case‑sensitive.
- Age and age are different identifiers.
- Analogy: Two lockers with “Age” and “age” are treated as separate lockers.

 4. No Reserved Keywords
- Cannot use Java keywords (like class, int, static) as identifiers.
- Analogy: You can’t name your locker “Principal” if that word is already reserved for the school.
 Invalid: int class = 5;

 5. No Spaces or Special Symbols
- Cannot contain spaces or symbols like @, #, %, !.
- Analogy: Locker names must be clean and simple — no emojis or special marks.
 Invalid: student name, roll#no

 6. Length
- No fixed limit, but should be reasonable and readable.
- Analogy: A locker name can be long, but shorter names are easier to find.

 7. Convention (Best Practices)
- Variables & methods: start with lowercase → studentName, calculateMarks()
- Classes & interfaces: start with uppercase → Student, Runnable
- Constants: all uppercase with underscores → MAX_VALUE

 Examples
// Valid identifiers
int age;
double salaryAmount;
String studentName;
final int MAX_MARKS = 100;

// Invalid identifiers
int 123abc;     // starts with digit
int roll#no;    // contains special symbol
int class;      // keyword used



 Final Takeaway
- Identifiers are names for lockers in memory.
- They must follow strict rules: start correctly, avoid keywords, no spaces/symbols, case‑sensitive.
- Follow conventions for clarity and professionalism.
