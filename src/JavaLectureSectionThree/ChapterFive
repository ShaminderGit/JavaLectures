Escape Sequences in Java

 What are Escape Sequences?
- An escape sequence is a special command inside a string or character literal that starts with a backslash \.
- It tells Java to do something special instead of just printing the symbol.
- They are used to format output or include special characters.
Example:
System.out.println("Hello\nWorld");
Output:
Hello
World

Here \n makes the text move to a new line.


 Common Escape Sequences in Java (with Examples)

1. \n → New Line
Moves the cursor to the next line.
System.out.println("Hello\nWorld");


Output:
Hello
World



2. \t → Tab Space
Adds a horizontal tab space.
System.out.println("A\tB\tC");


Output:
A    B    C


(Spaces depend on tab size, usually 4–8 spaces.)

3 \" → Double Quote
Allows double quotes inside a string.
System.out.println("She said \"Hello\"");


Output:
She said "Hello"


4 \' → Single Quote
Allows single quotes inside a string.
System.out.println("It\'s Java");


Output:
It's Java


5 \\ → Backslash
Prints a single backslash.
System.out.println("C:\\Users\\Shaminder");


Output:
C:\Users\Shaminder


6 \r → Carriage Return
Moves the cursor to the start of the line. Characters after \r overwrite what was before.
System.out.println("Hello\rWorld");


Output:
World



8 \b → Backspace
Removes the previous character.
System.out.println("ABC\bD");


Output:
ABD


(\b erased the C before printing D.)


 Final Takeaway
- Escape sequences are special codes starting with \.
- They let you format output or include special characters inside strings.
- Most useful ones: \n (new line), \t (tab), \" (quotes), \\ (backslash).
