Logical Operators in Java
1. Introduction
- Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate boolean values (true or false).
- They are most often used in decision-making statements like if, while, and for.
- Think of them as tools to check multiple conditions at once.

2. Types of Logical Operators
- AND (&&)
- Returns true only if both conditions are true.
- Example: (5 > 2 && 10 > 3) → true
- OR (||)
- Returns true if at least one condition is true.
- Example: (5 > 2 || 10 < 3) → true
- NOT (!)
- Reverses the boolean value.
- Example: !(5 > 2) → false

3. Example Program
public class LogicalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;
        boolean citizen = true;

        // AND operator
        if (age >= 18 && citizen) {
            System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
        }

        // OR operator
        if (age < 18 || !citizen) {
            System.out.println("Not eligible to vote");
        }

        // NOT operator
        boolean isMinor = !(age >= 18);
        System.out.println("Is minor: " + isMinor);
    }
}


Output:
Eligible to vote
Is minor: false



4. Analogy 🎓
Think of logical operators like teamwork rules:
- AND (&&) → Both teammates must agree before action happens.
- OR (||) → If at least one agrees, action happens.
- NOT (!) → Flips the decision (yes becomes no, no becomes yes).

5. Key Points
- Logical operators work only with boolean values.
- They are essential for complex conditions in programs.
- Often combined with relational operators (like <, >, ==) to make decisions.

✅ That’s the basic lecture.
Would you like me to also prepare a mini practice quiz on logical operators so your students can immediately test their understanding?
