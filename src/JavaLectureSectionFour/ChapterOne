Assignment Operators in Java
1. What They Are
- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
- The basic operator is = which simply stores the value on the right-hand side into the variable on the left-hand side.
Example:
int a = 10;   // assigns 10 to variable a

2. Types of Assignment Operators
Java provides compound assignment operators that combine arithmetic/bitwise operations with assignment:
-
= → Simple assignment
int x = 5; // assigns 5 to x
-
+= → Add and assign
x += 3; // x = x + 3
-
-= → Subtract and assign
x -= 2; // x = x - 2
-
*= → Multiply and assign
x *= 4; // x = x * 4
-
/= → Divide and assign
x
/= 2; // x = x / 2
-
%= → Modulus and assign
x %= 3; // x = x % 3
-
Bitwise compound assignments:
- &= (AND and assign)
- |= (OR and assign)
- ^= (XOR and assign)
- <<= (Left shift and assign)
- >>= (Right shift and assign)
- >>>= (Unsigned right shift and assign)

3. Why They’re Useful
- Concise code: Instead of writing x = x + 5;, you can write x += 5;.
- Readability: Makes intent clearer when performing operations and updating the same variable.
- Efficiency: Slightly reduces redundancy in code.
