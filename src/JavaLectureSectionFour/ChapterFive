Unary Operators in Java
1. Introduction
- Unary operators are operators that work on a single operand.
- They perform simple operations like incrementing, decrementing, or changing the sign of a value.
- Think of them as “one‑handed tools” — they only need one value to work.

2. Types of Unary Operators
- Unary Plus (+)
- Indicates a positive value (rarely used explicitly).
- Example: +5 is just 5.
- Unary Minus (-)
- Changes the sign of a number.
- Example:
int x = 5;
System.out.println(-x); // prints -5
- Increment (++)
- Increases a value by 1.
- Two forms:
- Prefix: ++x → increments first, then uses the value.
- Postfix: x++ → uses the value first, then increments.
- Decrement (--)
- Decreases a value by 1.
- Two forms:
- Prefix: --x → decrements first, then uses the value.
- Postfix: x-- → uses the value first, then decrements.
- Logical NOT (!)
- Flips a boolean value.
- Example:
boolean flag = true;
System.out.println(!flag); // prints false
