Relational Operators in Java
1. Introduction
- Relational operators are used to compare two values in Java.
- The result of any relational operation is always a boolean: either true or false.
- They are commonly used in decision-making statements like if, while, and for.

2. Types of Relational Operators
Let’s go through them one by one:
- Equal to (==) → Checks if two values are the same.
Example: 5 == 5 → true
- Not equal to (!=) → Checks if two values are different.
Example: 5 != 3 → true
- Greater than (>) → Checks if the left value is larger than the right.
Example: 7 > 4 → true
- Less than (<) → Checks if the left value is smaller than the right.
Example: 2 < 8 → true
- Greater than or equal to (>=) → True if the left value is larger or equal.
Example: 6 >= 6 → true
- Less than or equal to (<=) → True if the left value is smaller or equal.
Example: 3 <= 5 → true

3. Example Program
public class RelationalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10, b = 20;

        System.out.println(a == b);  // false
        System.out.println(a != b);  // true
        System.out.println(a > b);   // false
        System.out.println(a < b);   // true
        System.out.println(a >= b);  // false
        System.out.println(a <= b);  // true
    }
}


Output:
false
true
false
true
false
true



4. Key Points
- Always return true or false.
- Used heavily in loops and conditional statements.
- For objects like Strings, use .equals() instead of == to compare values.
- Order of relational operators is less that arithmetic operators.
