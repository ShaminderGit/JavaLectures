Lecture: Arithmetic Operators in Java
1. Introduction
Arithmetic operators are the basic symbols we use in Java to perform mathematical calculations.
They work on primitive data types like int, float, double, and long.
Think of them as the everyday math tools you already know, but now applied inside code.

2. The Operators Explained
- Addition (+)
Used to add two values together.
Example: 5 + 3 gives 8.
- Subtraction (-)
Used to subtract one value from another.
Example: 10 - 4 gives 6.
- Multiplication (*)
Used to multiply two values.
Example: 7 * 2 gives 14.
- Division (/)
Used to divide one value by another.
Example: 10 / 2 gives 5.
 Important: If both numbers are integers, the result will also be an integer
 (fractional part is discarded). For example, 10 / 3 gives 3, not 3.33.
- Modulus (%)
Used to find the remainder after division.
Example: 10 % 3 gives 1.
This operator is very useful for checking divisibility or working with cycles (like days of the week).

3. Code Demonstration
public class ArithmeticDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10, b = 3;

        System.out.println("Addition: " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("Division: " + (a / b)); // integer division
        System.out.println("Modulus: " + (a % b));
    }
}


Output:
Addition: 13
Subtraction: 7
Multiplication: 30
Division: 3
Modulus: 1



4. Key Notes for Students
- Integer division discards decimals.
- Use floating-point numbers (double or float) if you want precise division results.
- The modulus operator is especially handy for problems like checking if
  a number is even (n % 2 == 0) or odd (n % 2 != 0).
