Shorthand Assignment Operators
Java provides combined operators that perform an operation and assignment in one step:
- += → Add and assign
x += 5; // same as x = x + 5
- -= → Subtract and assign
x -= 3; // same as x = x - 3
- *= → Multiply and assign
x *= 2; // same as x = x * 2
- /= → Divide and assign
x /= 4; // same as x = x / 4
- %= → Modulus and assign
x %= 3; // same as x = x % 3



3. Example Program
public class AssignmentDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;

        x += 5;  // x = 15
        x -= 3;  // x = 12
        x *= 2;  // x = 24
        x /= 4;  // x = 6
        x %= 5;  // x = 1

        System.out.println("Final value of x: " + x);
    }
}



4. Key Takeaway
- Shorthand assignment operators make code shorter and cleaner.
- They are widely used in loops, counters, and mathematical calculations.
