SectionOne Chapter 3

1. What is an Algorithm?
- An algorithm is a step‑by‑step set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.
- Just like a recipe in cooking: it tells you what to do first, second, third… until the dish is ready.
- In programming, algorithms guide the computer on how to solve problems.
2. Why Do We Need Algorithms?
- They make problem solving organized.
- Help programmers write code that is clear and efficient.
- Same algorithm can be used in different programming languages
3. Example (Daily Life)
Algorithm to make tea:
- Boil water.
- Add tea leaves.
- Add sugar and milk.
- Stir for 2 minutes.
- Pour into a cup.
- Tea is ready.
This is not code, but it shows how step‑by‑step instructions lead to a result
4. Example (Programming)
Algorithm to add two numbers:
- Start.
- Take input of two numbers (say A and B).
- Add A and B.
- Store the result in C.
- Print C.
- Stop.
Key Idea
- Algorithm = Recipe for solving a problem.
- Without an algorithm, programming would be confusing and unorganized.
