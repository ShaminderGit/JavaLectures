ChapterFour What is Syntax?


In programming, syntax is the set of rules that define how code must be
written so that the computer can understand and run it.
If you break the rules (like missing a semicolon or using the wrong keyword),
the program won’t work.

1. What is Syntax?
- Syntax = Grammar of a programming language.
- Just like English has grammar rules (subject + verb + object), programming languages have syntax rules.
- If you don’t follow these rules, the computer gives an error.

2. Why Syntax Matters
- Ensures the computer can read and execute your instructions.
- Helps programmers communicate clearly with the machine.
- Prevents confusion and mistakes in code.

3. Example in Human Language
- Correct English: “I am learning Java.”
- Wrong English: “Java learning am I.”
- Both use the same words, but only the first follows grammar rules.
- Same idea applies in programming.
