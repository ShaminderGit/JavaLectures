 Chapter 2: What Is Programming Language

1. Human Languages
- Examples: Hindi, English, Punjabi, etc.
- Humans use these to communicate with each other.
- Computers cannot understand human languages directly.

2. Computer Language (Machine Language)
- Computers only understand 0 (off) and 1 (on).
- This is called machine language or binary code.
- Very hard for humans to read and write.

3.Assembly Language
 - A step above machine language.
 - Uses short codes (called mnemonics) like ADD, MOV, SUB.
 - Easier than pure 0s and 1s, but still close to hardware.
 - Needs an assembler to convert assembly code into machine code.

4. High‑Level Languages
- Examples: Java, Python, C++.
- Easy for humans to read and write (similar to English).
- Not understood directly by computers.
- Needs a compiler or interpreter to translate into machine language.

5. Compiler Role
- A compiler converts high‑level language (like Java) into low‑level language (machine/assembly).
- This allows the computer to execute the program.
- Without a compiler, the computer cannot understand high‑level code.


In Java, we don’t go directly from high‑level language to machine language.
First, the compiler makes bytecode.
Then the JVM takes that bytecode and translates it into machine language.
That’s why Java programs can run anywhere — the JVM does the heavy lifting.

Here is the detailed explanation

1. Writing Code
- You write Java code in a high‑level language (easy for humans to read).
- Example:
System.out.println("Hello Students");
2. Compilation
- Java uses a compiler (javac) to translate high‑level code into bytecode.
- Bytecode is not machine language, but a special intermediate form.
- File created: HelloStudents.class.
3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Bytecode runs inside the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- JVM acts like a translator between bytecode and the computer’s machine language (0s and 1s).
- This makes Java platform‑independent — the same .class file runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.
4. Execution
- JVM converts bytecode into machine code at runtime using an interpreter or JIT (Just‑In‑Time) compiler.
- Finally, the computer executes the instructions.
